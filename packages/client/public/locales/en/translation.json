You will have to complete questionnaires and reports using the web browser of your computer, electronic tablet or smart phone.</p><p> A first questionnaire aims to collect identification information regarding you and your clinic, academic training and practice characteristics as well as the therapeutic modalities you use in clinic. To complete this questionnaire will require 10 minutes of your time.</p><p> You will then need to invite by email, ten of your new patients to register on the Web app « PatientProgress ». Following their registration, the web app will ask them to complete an initial intake form as well as three pain and disability questionnaires related to their chief complaint.</p><p> These questionnaires will need to be completed prior to your initial consultation with these new patients. You will have access to their answers to help you take your history and complete your patient’s examination.</p><p> After the initial consultation with each patient, you will need to complete an initial report using the web app. The first part of the report is automatically generated by « PatientProgress » and includes patient identification data, sociodemographic data, patient’s complaints and reported pain distribution, comorbidities, red flags as well as pain and disability ratings. In the second part of this report, you will need to note the relevant objective findings related to your initial assessment and indicate your diagnosis. You will also need to describe your plan of management including the number and frequency of recommended treatments, therapeutic objectives, treatment modalities and physical activity instructions. If you indicate that a referral is required, you will be asked to specify the nature and motive of that interprofessional consult request. Finally, you will be asked to define your prognosis. You will need approximately 10 minutes to complete this initial report on the web app “PatientProgress”.</p><p> Prior to the last treatment or the twelfth treatment (if your treatment plan requires more than twelve treatments), you will need to ask your patient to complete using the web app, a follow up questionnaire as well as the same pain and disability questionnaires completed prior to the initial consultation. You will then complete a clinical reevaluation of your patient’s condition and complete a reevaluation report on the web app. This reevaluation report is similar to the initial report with some added information. The first section indicates percent improvement noted on the different outcome measures while the second section requires you qualify the response to the care provided. You will need 10 minutes to complete this reevaluation report on the web app “PatientProgress”.</p><p> After completing the reevaluation reports of your ten participating patients, you will be asked to answer a questionnaire evaluation the usability of the web app « PatientProgress. This last questionnaire will take 10 minutes to complete.</p><h4>Risks and inconveniences</h4><p> No risk is associated to your participation to this research project.

  "privacy": "<h2>Privacy Policy</h2><h3>1. Introduction</h3><p> The 'PatientProgress' web application allows healthcare professionals to invite their patients to complete the questionnaires necessary to monitor their health condition in a digital and computerized way. These can be completed before the patient's arrival at the clinic on a computer, an electronic tablet or a smart phone equipped with a web browser. The user-friendly interface of the web application makes it possible to succinctly collect the most relevant information according to the patient's health condition.</p><p> The web application also facilitates the production of personalized reports that integrate the information collected. These reports are attached to the professional's patient file to facilitate the diagnostic process, the development of the treatment plan and the monitoring of conditions requiring health care.</p><p> Finally, this technological tool greatly simplifies the implementation of scientific studies. It allows the creation of a coded database from the information provided by patients and professionals who agree to participate in research using this web application while keeping their identity confidential. The format of the digital data collected also allows the data to be analyzed more quickly and efficiently. Ultimately, these scientific studies should lead to improved health care delivery.</p><h3>2. Personal information</h3><p> Any factual or subjective information about an identifiable individual is considered personal. This personal information may include, but is not limited to, first and last name, address, telephone numbers, gender, e-mail address, information on marital and family status, lifestyle or health status.</p><p> Personal information must be protected regardless of the nature of its medium and whatever its form: written, graphic, audio, visual, computerized or other.</p><h3>3. Our engagement</h3><p> We have established and implemented internal policies and procedures aimed at adequately protecting the personal information in our possession and we review them on a regular basis.</p><p> We make our employees aware of the importance of protecting personal information by requiring them to undergo ongoing training in this regard and by issuing directives outlining their obligations in this regard from time to time.</p><h3>4. Purposes of Information Collection</h3><p> We collect this personal and confidential information on behalf of healthcare professionals who hold a user account on the “PatientProgress” web application. This personal and confidential information will be communicated exclusively to the health professional whose services you request. In all cases, the communication of your personal and confidential information will be subject to obligations to maintain confidentiality and respect applicable laws.</p><h3>5. Consent</h3><p> Subject to the exceptions and requirements of applicable laws, we will not communicate or disclose your personal information to anyone without your consent.</p><p> By using the 'PatientProgress' web application, you consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal and confidential information in accordance with this policy.</p><p> Your consent will be given when you tick a box while completing your registration on the “PatientProgress” web application.</p><p>You can withdraw your consent at any time.</p><h3>6. Limits on Collection, Use and Disclosure</h3><p> We use the web application to collect the information needed to keep a patient file. More specifically, the personal information collected makes it possible to identify and communicate with the patient (e.g. name, date of birth, gender, address, telephone number(s), email address, etc.) as well as clinical information ( g.: reason(s) for consultation, health problem(s), personal and family history as well as information on medication, physical activity, pain intensity and disability, etc.)</p><p> We also collect information that identifies the healthcare professional treating each patient. Some information makes it possible to communicate with the professional (e.g. name, profession, telephone number, address of the clinic of the clinic, etc.) Other information makes it possible to specify the academic training of the professional and to describe both, its practice environment, and its therapeutic tools. In addition, we collect the diagnoses and the treatment plan defined by the professional for each patient and the data to measure the effect of the treatments over time.</p><p> We may use the personal information collected to respond to your requests for information, to improve our service offer, to meet legal requirements and to prevent errors or cases of fraud</p><p> We limit the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information only to the purposes that we have indicated to you. Your personal information can only be consulted by authorized persons, and only in the context of the tasks assigned to them. In all cases, we comply with legal restrictions and requirements (Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels dans le secteur privé ; chapitre P-39.1) when disclosing your personal information.</p><p> Access to personal information is strictly limited. Thus, healthcare professionals can only access the information of their own patients who have consented to use the 'PatientProgress' web application.</p><p> Access to personal information by third parties is also strictly limited. Thus, your personal data may be used for research purposes only after obtaining your prior consent. Personal information coded where all direct and indirect identifiers are removed may be shared for research purposes. However, research projects must first be approved by a scientific and university ethics committee. Only the data of patients and professionals who have consented to share this coded information for research purposes will be accessible to researchers according to a pre-established protocol. The overall goal of these clinical research projects is to improve the delivery of health care.</p><p>We do not sell your personal information to third parties.</p><h3>7. Exactness</h3><p> We do everything in our power to ensure that your personal information is accurate and complete for the purposes for which it was collected, used or disclosed.</p><h3>8. Retention of information</h3><p> We retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected. We must delete this information in accordance with the law (Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels dans le secteur privé ; chapitre P-39.1) and our records retention policy.</p><p> Your personal and confidential information is kept only for the time necessary to meet the needs of your healthcare professional and the applicable legal and regulatory requirements. In all cases, access to your personal and confidential information is restricted to persons for whom access is required in the performance of their duties.</p><h3>9. Responsibility</h3><p> We are responsible for personal information in our possession or in our custody, including information that we transfer to third parties for the purpose of providing you with the professional services requested. We require these third parties to maintain this information under the same strict standards of confidentiality and security.</p><p> We adhere to the principles set out in the law (Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels dans le secteur privé ; chapitre P-39.1) . We have implemented policies and guidelines, which ensure the protection of your privacy. Our Privacy and Information Technology Security Officers oversee this Privacy Policy.</p><p> We ensure that our personnel are informed and properly trained on policies and practices relating to the protection of personal information.</p><h3>10. Security measures</h3><p> We have implemented several security measures with respect to the personal information and confidential data that we hold in order to protect them against loss, theft and to prevent access, transmission, use or unauthorized modification of this personal information, in particular by:</p><p> The infrastructure and equipment are hosted in a secure environment in a data center located in Canada.</p><p> Only employees whose duties require it are likely to have access to personal or confidential information. Data access is logged and monitored.</p><p> Our employees and partners are trained and aware of the importance of protecting your personal information.</p><p> Our employees sign a confidentiality undertaking and failure to comply with this undertaking may lead to sanctions which may go as far as dismissal.</p><p> The 'PatientProgress' application uses several web security measures. The application is divided into two parts: the first is a client application and the second is an application programming interface (API). The client application is accessible via the URL https://app.patientprogress.ca/ and the API is accessible via the URL https://api.patientprogress.ca/. Thus, when a patient completes a questionnaire or a professional completes a report, the data is transmitted from the client application to the API, where it is processed and transmitted to the database using the SSL/TLS protocol encrypting this data during their transportation. This protocol thus ensures data integrity and server authentication. The data is stored in a database located in Canada where it is encrypted.</p><p> Other security measures are implemented in order to comply with the OWASP Web Application Security Testing Checklist and the OWASP testing guide. These measures target both the client application and the API. They are recognized as good security practices and have been implemented in the application to increase security.</p><p> Access to personal information is governed by strict permissions. The patient only has access to the name of his professional, his own date of birth and his gender as well as the questionnaires he must complete. Thus, in the event of an intrusion, the damage is minimized. The professional has access to all of the personal and confidential information collected for each of his patients. A two-factor authentication measure is implemented. When connecting from a new IP address, the professional receives a code by email that he must enter into the application in order to connect.</p><p> All requests made to the server are logged. Thus, the administrator can see the source of the traffic and take the necessary actions.</p><h3>11. Request for access to information and modifications</h3><p> You may, following the filing of a request and following reasonable notice, subject to any restrictions of a regulatory or contractual nature, consult or have corrected the personal information that we hold about you.</p><p> We will provide you with such information within a reasonable time from the date of receipt of the written request.</p><p> In certain specific circumstances, we may refuse to provide you with the requested information. Exceptions to your right of access occur particularly if the information cannot be disclosed for legal or security reasons. These limitations are described in the Act respecting the protection of personal information in the private sector (Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels dans le secteur privé ; chapitre P-39.1).</p><p> You can verify the accuracy and completeness of your personal information and, if necessary, request its modification. Any request for modification will be treated within the framework of the law (Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels dans le secteur privé ; chapitre P-39.1).</p><p> Any request for access to personal information or changes to personal information must be sent to the address below:</p><br/><p>PatientProgress Team</p><p>Hains Technologies</p><p>Email: info@hainstech.com</p><br/><h3>12. Complaints and questions</h3><p> We are committed to answering your questions and concerns regarding the protection of your personal information. If you are not satisfied with the answer, you can contact the Privacy Officer at the address mentioned below.</p><p> Any complaints regarding the protection of personal information should be directed to the Privacy Officer at the address listed below.</p><p>Responsible for the protection of personal information:</p><br/><p>François Hains</p><p>Vice President, Hains Technologies</p><p>info@hainstech.com</p><br/><h3>13.
